The Polkadot network is really just a decentralized application layer powered by a network of specialized blockchains.

These blockchains are commonly referred to as "parachains" within the Polkadot ecosystem.

They come in 3 main categories:

1. **Infrastructure chains:** these provide core primitives for web3 applications to use, for example chains that specialize in managing DIDs, various asset classes or on-chain collectives.
2. **Application chains:** these are chains that specialize in providing an application layer tailored for specific end-user use cases. Chains in this category can also provide a smart contract execution layer in addition to their specialized functionality.
3. **Generalized chains:** these are chains that provide a smart contract execution layer, making them generalized and allowing developers to permissionlessly deploy any type of application.

Each of these types of chains provide services for creating and managing non-fungible assets of various types.
Some tailored for specific market verticals

## App chains for non-fungible asset markets

Here's an overview of the app-chains who provide services for non-fungible assets creation on Polkadot:

| Appchain       | Core value proposition | Type of chain |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Astar          |             | Generalized
| Aventus Network |            | Application
| Basilisk       |             | Application 
| Efinity        |             | Application
| Moonbeam       |             | Generalized
| Polkadot/Kusama Asset Hub |   | Infrastructure
| Unique Network |              | Infrastructure
