## Claiming and distributing items

The NFTs pallet supports popular distribution techniques designed to onboard users with more ease and efficiency, including:

- The ability for a collection owner to send the items manually
- The ability for anyone to claim an item, either for free or by paying a predetermined price
- The ability to distribute items to a whitelist of account addresses
- The ability to distribute items via a secret code

## Integration for private marketplaces

The growing number of collections reveals the need to have private marketplaces those focus on a specific type of NFT, like real estate or gaming items. Each of these marketplaces might have their own fee set and pre-approval process. The pallet is designed such that marketplaces can set the fees and manage the added collections or items.
