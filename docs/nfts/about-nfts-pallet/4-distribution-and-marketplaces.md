The NFTs pallet supports popular distribution techniques designed to onboard users with more ease and efficiency, including:

- The ability for a collection owner to send the items manually
- The ability for anyone to claim an item, either for free or by paying a predetermined price
- The ability to distribute items to a whitelist of account addresses
- The ability to distribute items via a secret code

## Integration for private marketplaces

Collections of real estate or gaming items can have their own marketplaces that set collection-specific trading fees using the pre-approval process.

For example, if you wanted to list your NFT on some marketplace, the marketplace can require to give it permission to set a trading fee for the item you list. This would be stored inside the item's attributes.
When your NFT gets sold, the marketplace will include the fee payment as part of the sale.
